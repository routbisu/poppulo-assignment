## Poppulo Frontend Engineer Assignment

This project was built using [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) that is used by CRA internally.

#### Demo

Here is a [link](https://poppulo-assignment.web.app/) to the demo.

#### Potential Improvements

Because of time constraints, I kept this project minimalistic for demo purposes. If this were a real world project, I would add these improvements to it:

- Typescript or flow (for type safety).
- Use of styled components for better CSS styles scoping.
- Configure the use of multiple environments (`staging` and `production`).
- Implement service workers to support installation & offline capabilities.
- Write a CI/CD pipeline on Bitbucket or Gitlab or other platforms.
- Write unit tests with Jest & Enzyme.
- End to end testing with Puppeteer or Cypress.
